# json-validator

This repository contains sample code for validating JSON paylos using an OpenAPI specification file as the schema definition. This sample code can help satisfy use cases including:

- Confirming that JSON data are valid for submission to an Ed-Fi Resource API (i.e. the Ed-Fi ODS/API) before issuing an HTTP `POST` or `PUT` request.
- Validating that JSON files stored in a data lake conform to the Ed-Fi Data Standard, as represented by the Ed-Fi API Specification.
